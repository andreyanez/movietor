# Movietor!

Small movie app made for learning purposes. See details about the latests and most popular movies posted on the The Movie Database

**Link to project:** https://movietorapp.netlify.app/

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Vite (Javascript Tooling), Vue (Javascript Framework), Tailwindcss(CSS Framework), DaisyUI(Component Library)

I wanted to make this small app to make use of recent technologies i've been practising, DaisyUI and Tailwindcss, to be more specific.

## Optimizations

There's definetly much more to be done improving the UX (adding a search bar, fetching movies AND TV shows, filter searching)

## Lessons Learned:

This project helped me get more familiar with Axios (promise based HTTP Client), using a utility-first css Framework (I tend to make all the css from scratch) and most importantly,
using a Component library with DaisyUI. I realize now that writing html and css from scratch isn't as necessary anymore, as there's so many new ways to create layouts and components.

This mindset gives you way more time to focus on user experience, and that's cool!

## Examples:

Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
